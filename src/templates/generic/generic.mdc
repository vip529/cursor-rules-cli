# General Coding Conventions

## General Principles

- Write clean, readable, maintainable code
- Follow the existing code style and conventions in the repository
- Keep functions and modules small and focused
- Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes
- Comment complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code

## Code Changes

- Make diff-ready patches (minimal, focused changes)
- Test changes before committing
- Update documentation when changing behavior
- Keep commits atomic and well-described

## Before Large Refactors

- Ask one clarifying question to ensure understanding
- Confirm the scope and impact of the change
- Consider backward compatibility
- Plan for incremental changes when possible

## Quality Assurance

- Use linters and formatters configured in the project
- Run existing tests and ensure they pass
- Write tests for new functionality
- Fix warnings and errors before committing

## Security & Best Practices

- Validate all external inputs
- Don't commit secrets or sensitive data
- Handle errors gracefully
- Follow language-specific best practices

## Don't

- Don't make unnecessary changes outside the scope
- Don't ignore existing conventions
- Don't skip error handling
- Don't commit commented-out code
- Don't use overly clever solutions when simple ones suffice
